# DoodleFinn 2



## Introduction

This document outlines our project idea, a 2D-platformer game titled “DoodleFinn 2”. This game is a sequel to the 2D game, [DoodleFinn](https://doodlefinn-9e0c7.web.app/). This game demonstrates a 2D-platforming, side scrolling game with 3D graphics. Players will find themselves facing complex platforming and challenging puzzles to solve each level. 

## Technology

DoodleFinn 2 will be programmed using Unreal Engine with graphics and animations designed in Blender.

## Backstory

In the first game, DoodleFinn was able to collect all the scraps of paper to form a letter from Finn to Charlie. Now, it seems that Finn has left behind his present for Charlie. To help him, DoodleFinn has escaped the notebook and must traverse the school to get the present back to Finn. Will he make it on time, and in one piece?

## Objective

Playing as DoodleFinn, the goal is to be able to navigate school in order to reach Finn and give him the gift for Charlie, but there are many obstacles in the way! DoodleFinn will have to climb books and desks, avoid being stepped on or hit with a dodgeball, and solve difficult puzzles in the chemistry lab and opening Finn’s locker.

## Gameplay/Controls

DoodleFinn 2 will have basic controls for platforming, such as moving left and right, and jumping. DoodleFinn also has the ability to “interact” with objects to solve puzzles.
### Controls (subject to change):
- [A] - Move Left
- [D] - Move Right
- [Space] - Jump
- [E] - Interact

## Graphical User Interface

The graphical user interface will include the following:

- Splash Screen: A still image displayed before the game play begins. Presents the game logo and a “start” button.
- Help Menu: Can be reached at any point in the game to pause gameplay and return to the title screen or restart the level.
- Game Over Screen: Shows when the player has run out of health. Player has the ability to return to the title screen or restart the level.
- Credit Screen: Displayed at the end of the game. Displays a “The End” image and the credits for those who have worked on the game.

## Artwork

## Sound Effects
